# BookLocatorApp
This is an application where you don't have to manually go searching through hundereds of shelves to find your book..just enter the book name or author name and tada!
The map view of the library with the exact location of your book is displayed...plus we have linked the app with GoogleBooks API so that you can know more about the book you wish to issue!
